# Hello Hackers
First module to be attempted from pwn.college and has two challenges.

# Intro To Commands
Just includes the user to invoke a command `hello` in order to recieve the flag.

After opening the terminal typing in `hello` and pressing the `enterkey` gives the flag.

The flag is `pwn.college{wqyVVGuzeqalL8xntu6CFMM0z3W.ddjNyUDLzkDN0czW}`.

# Intro To Arguments
It includes the user to run the `hello` command with a single argument `hackers` which gives the flag.

In the example given a command `echo` is used with the argument `Hello Hackers!` which displays `Hello Hackers!`.

Following the same steps, after opening the terminal enter `hello hackers` which gives us the flag.

The flag is `pwn.college{MPNS305mMkfJDnMEiobyVaG6xFq.dhjNyUDLzkDN0czW}`.
