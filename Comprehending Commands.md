# Comprehending Commands
Third module to be attempted and contains 12 challenges

# cat: not the pet, but the command!
Requires the user to use the `cat` command to read a file.

It is given that the flag is copied to the `flag` file in the home directory.

Hence typing `cat flag` we get the key.

The key is `pwn.college{U8tYlRUcaJIQXHn3Y9mq6LesVqH.dFzN1QDLzkDN0czW}`.

# catting absolute paths
Requires the user to use the `cat` command to read a file.

It is given that the flag is stored in the `flag` file in the home directory.

Hence typing `cat /flag` we get the key.

The key is `pwn.college{0KOJrFtfD7aJEBXiZeomnigxBj7.dlTM5QDLzkDN0czW}`.

# more catting practice
Requires the user to use the `cat` command to read a file.

It is given that the flag is stored in the `flag` file in the some directory.

The directory in which it is stored is `/lib/gprolog/bin`.

Hence typing `cat /lib/gprolog/bin/flag` we get the key.

The key is `pwn.college{ch8P9j-JHC6Zn07l7SFtEGQc2xY.dBjM5QDLzkDN0czW}`.

# grepping for a needle in a haystack
Requires the user to use the `grep` command to find the flag in a very large text file.

It is given that the flag is stored in `/challenge/data.txt`.

Hence typing `grep pwn.college  /challenge/data.txt` gives us the key.

The key is `pwn.college{0kCFcuSvh4wfhtsbepvHz5cup3W.ddTM4QDLzkDN0czW}`.
