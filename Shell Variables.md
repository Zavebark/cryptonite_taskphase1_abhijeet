# Shell Variables
Is the 7th module and has 8 problems to solve.

## Printing Variables
Requires the user to read a variable which gives the flag.

The flag is given by `echo $FLAG`.

Where `$` specifies that it is a variable.
 
The flag is `pwn.college{cM06CFMyMWf2_dMED2p_P3Zs0xp.ddTN1QDLzkDN0czW}`.

## Setting Variables
Requires the user to use `=` and assign a value to a variable.

To get the flag use `PWN=COLLEGE` which in turn gives the flag.

The flag is `pwn.college{8Dm1xityn3Oie1RRw37jJroco4y.dlTN1QDLzkDN0czW}`.

## Multi-word Variables
Requires the user to understand the use of `""` in assigning multi word values to a variable.

To get the flag use `PWN="COLLEGE YEAH"`.

The flag is `pwn.college{ck2Re03QfaG1PzkUD10WOkPmRK-.dBjN1QDLzkDN0czW}`.
